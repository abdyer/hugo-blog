      <description>&lt;div class=&#39;post&#39;&gt;
Jamie I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myspace.com/matesofstate&#34;&gt;Mates of State&lt;/a&gt; this past Thursday at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.warehouselive.com/&#34;&gt;Warehouse Live&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ve really been digging their new album, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Re-Arrange-Us-Mates-State/dp/B0016MJ2PU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1213562189&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Re-Arrange Us&lt;/a&gt; and it was my first time to see them live.  For only two people, their unique combination of keyboard, drums, and vocal harmony makes for a nice, full sound.  I picked their latest up on vinyl, which overflowed my record collection into its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40101276&#34;&gt;2nd crate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s a video I took of &#34;Get Better&#34; and &#34;Think Long&#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height=&#34;344&#34; width=&#34;425&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/Xvy7qcLM-PQ&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/Xvy7qcLM-PQ&amp;amp;hl=en&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; height=&#34;344&#34; width=&#34;425&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie surprised me with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Critic-Houston-Restaurant-Guide/dp/0974014346/&#34;&gt;Fearless Critic&#39;s guide to Houston restaurants&lt;/a&gt; and since I&#39;ve been wanting some Korean food for awhile now, we checked the reviews and decided to try &lt;a href=&#34;http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/43106853/houston_tx/bonga_korean_restaurant.html&#34;&gt;Bonga&lt;/a&gt; the other night.  I lived in Korea a couple times as a kid when my dad was stationed there, so I was familiar with a few of the dishes.  We shared &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi&#34;&gt;bulgogi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi&#34;&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, two of the most well-known.  It was great to try something new and the review gave us confidence that we wouldn&#39;t be disappointed.  We weren&#39;t.  The guide gave it a grade of A- and I have to agree.  Very tasty stuff at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met some friends at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onioncreekcafe.com/&#34;&gt;Onion Creek&lt;/a&gt; for dinner last night, mainly because I wanted to try &lt;a href=&#34;http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/337/43157&#34;&gt;Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #6&lt;/a&gt;, a limited release beer OC has on draft.  This edition is an American &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley_wine&#34;&gt;Barleywine&lt;/a&gt; and for those of you who aren&#39;t beer geeks, think of running to the record store when your favorite band puts out a new album.  Only replace record store with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.specsonline.com/&#34;&gt;Spec&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; and album with limited edition microbrew.  In other words, something to get excited about if you&#39;re into such things.  The beer weighs in at a hefty 10% abv, so a couple pints was all I could endure in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I wanted some non-&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.starbucks.com/&#34;&gt;corporate coffee&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to stop by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.b4-u-eat.com/houston/restaurants/reviews/rsv0996.asp&#34;&gt;Cafe Artiste&lt;/a&gt; for some.  I was very disappointed to find the parking lot empty and a &#34;For Lease&#34; sign in the window.  That was such a great place!  It will be missed...&lt;/div&gt;
