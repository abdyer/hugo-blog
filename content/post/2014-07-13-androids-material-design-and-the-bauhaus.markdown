Since Android Gingerbread (v2.3), loyalists know that each version has an Easter egg that can be accessed by repeatedly tapping the version number on the Settings > About screen. The Android "L" Preview is no exception.

While test driving the new version, I naturally had to see what Google had hidden for me in their latest release. Previous versions have had everything from [gingerbread zombies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeAFCIvqNxc) to [Nyandroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfY73GBBHxg) and a [pile of jelly beans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN-nJdAJS7g). The Android "L" Preview build has a [simple animation of random overlapping red and blue rectangles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_He5MIYJas8). Several Android blogs mentioned this, but dismissed it as [mysterious](http://www.androidcentral.com/android-l-Previews-easter-egg-webdriver-torso) and [strange](http://www.slashgear.com/hands-on-with-the-android-l-features-google-didnt-mention-27335613/). While these random rectangles are clearly the same used by Google's [WebDriver Torso](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27778071) YouTube video quality testing, so far everyone seems to have missed the most obvious explanation.

On my trip to Berlin to speak at [DroidCon](http://de.droidcon.com/2014/session/froyo-kitkat-two-years-developing-maintaining-deliradio) this past May, I visited the [Bauhaus Archive](http://www.bauhaus.de/de/bauhaus-archiv/). There I learned quite a bit about the history of Germany's world-renowned design school, including their study of basic shapes and primary colors. Among the many drawings, paintings, and other exhibits was this piece by [Lásló Moholy-Nagy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Moholy-Nagy):

Clearly, the Android "L" Preview Easter egg and Material Design itself are a nod to the Bauhaus' influence. It is the Bauhaus aesthetic made digital; layered [red](http://cdn.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nexusae0_Screenshot_"2014-06-26"

The real mystery is why a Google search for "[android material design bauhaus](https://www.google.com/search?q=android+material+design+bauhaus)" currently only returns a [couple](http://www.ukessays.com/essays/cultural-studies/influence-of-the-bauhaus-on-design-cultural-studies-essay.php) [results](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2794642&page=4) that make this connection. This is my attempt to make it at least three.
