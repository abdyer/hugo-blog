I presented "Things That Suck About Android Development" at this year's [mdevcon](http://mdevcon.com/) conference in Amsterdam. It's a great conference in an amazing city. I highly recommend it to anyone developing mobile apps.

The title is admittedly a bit sensational, but my goal was to highlight many of the painful parts about developing for Android and how to avoid/fix them.

Here are the slides!
