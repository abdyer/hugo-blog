I gave a two hour tutorial on developing for Android at work today for our weekly tech talk. Similar in style to my coworker [Aaron Ortbals'](http://aaronortbals.com/) [tutorial on Ember.js](https://github.com/aortbals/ember-github-example), I showed how to build a client for [GitHub's Events API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/).

Topics included:

1. Project setup
2. Gradle dependencies
3. API requests & JSON parsing
4. Activities & fragments
5. Lists, adapters, and custom item layouts

You can find the source code and the slides for the tutorial [on GitHub](https://github.com/abdyer/android-intro).
