It's the time of the year when [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) has gotten too elfing hard and I use what's left of the year's productive energy to publish my list of favorite albums.

I discovered a few new artists/groups this year, but an AI trained only on previous years' lists could have correctly guessed half of these:

1. **Ty Segall - Three Bells** Another batch of perfectly baked psych pop/rock from a longtime favorite. I saw him play yet again at the Gothic Theatre back in May.

1. **Osees - SORCS 80** Not only did they release an album without any guitars on it, they also simultaneously released a live version (complete with [rooftop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQZ3-ovNZQU)) of it! I saw their show at the Ogden Theatre in the fall. They didn't play a single track off this album, but gave the bouncing crowd a couple hours of everything else they've released over the past several years.

1. **Jessica Pratt - Here in the Pitch** The melody, reverb, and Pet Sounds style production on the opening track "Life Is" hooked me immediately. The album demands a rainy day and headphones in order to get properly acquainted. The styles vary throughout, but the introspective mood persists.

1. **DIIV - Frog in Boiling Water** Shoegazy sounds are having a bit of a resurgence (hi, [Wisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBjbNkGAESk)). DIIV's latest certainly fits the moment, but its tracks explore the full range of the genre with a bit of grunge thrown in.

1. **The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis - The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis** Members of Fugazi plus some jazz musicians?! It's as thoroughly satisfying as it sounds. 

1. **J.R.C.G. - Grim Iconic... (Sadistic Mantra)** This band's sound is so dense and primal. I added it to my streaming music library after hearing a track on All Songs Considered and then forgot about it for a few days. When I eventually gave the album a listen, I kept thinking about how thoughtful my past self was to leave this gift for me. ü•∞ The only thing that diminished the joy of discovering this band was learning they had just played in Denver the night before. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Khruangbin - A LA SALA** This band is so dependable that someone in the group is usually able to guess who it is within the opening seconds of most songs. This is a good thing, like tacos at your favorite spot, maybe "a la salsa".

1. **Kendrick Lamar - GNX** It is mandatory to have this surprise/late album drop in your best of list, so here it is. DAMN is still my favorite Kendrick album, but this one joins the short list.

1. **Vince Staples - Dark Times** The other Compton rapper on the list and one who's been on a few of my favorite albums lists over the years. I appreciate the well-placed Eazy-E sample in "Radio". I don't generally like singing in my hip-hop, but Vince & Kendrick have been sneaking it in regularly enough to warm me up to it a little.

1. **Stress Eater - Everybody Eats!** When I thought the year's new music was winding down, this Record Store Day release from Kool Keith & Czarface hit streaming services. INS is missing from this configuration, but it still fits nicely alongside other recent Czarface releases.

Here's a playlist with a song from each of the above albums:
