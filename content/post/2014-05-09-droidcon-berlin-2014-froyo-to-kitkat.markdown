I'm thrilled to be speaking at Droidcon Berlin this year. I fell in love with the city on my first visit and the conference was a perfect reason for another visit. Attempts to try out my very basic German skills have shown me that I have a long way to go. However, I am proud to say that I have managed to make a few purchases without panicking and falling back to English.

The slides are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Daz4FEcG6DZHUtVXk3TWl2VjA/edit?usp=sharing). Watch out world, I'm an "international speaker" now. ;)
