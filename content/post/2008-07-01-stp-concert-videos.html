The Stone Temple Pilots concert this past Saturday <strong>ROCKED</strong>! See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dammitandy+stone+temple+pilots&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f">my videos on YouTube</a> for proof, you skeptics. I didn't see them "back in the day" so it was great to finally get the chance. Only two things could have made it better - new songs (where are they, guys?) and reasonable prices for beer (they were $10 for a 24 oz Shiner). But as I said before, I'm not much of a ranter so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Here's "Dead and Bloated", one of the most rockinest (that's my "Aww yeah!" a few seconds into the song):<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v5JkPgvVkWM&amp;hl=en"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v5JkPgvVkWM&hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div>
