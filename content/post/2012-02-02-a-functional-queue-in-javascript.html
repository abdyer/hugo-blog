It's been over a year since I've posted here, but I've been busy delving into Android and Ruby on Rails among other things. To get back into blogging (hopefully more regularly...we'll see), I thought I'd share an interesting JavaScript exercise I was asked to complete as part of a job interview recently.
</p>
<p>
The task was to build a functional queue in JavaScript.  A functional queue is a queue (first in, first out) which is implemented with no side-effects.  For instance, a function to enqueue a value onto an existing queue will return a new object which represents the larger queue.  The original (smaller) queue is still available.
</p>
<p>
In order to implement a functional queue, we need to be able to do a few things that are not immediately obvious in Javascript:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new instance of the array of queue items when an item is enqueued/dequeued</li>
	<li>Overload the class constructor so it can be created with an empty array (new queue) or an existing array (result of a enqueue/dequeue operation</li>
	<li>Return both the dequeued item and a new queue as a result of a dequeue operation</li>
</ol>
<p>
To return a new instance of the array of queue items, we can leverage the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice">array.slice()</a> method, which selects part of an array and returns a new array.  The trick here is to pass an index of zero to the slice method to get a new array instance and then use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push">array.push()</a> to enqueue or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift">array.shift()</a> to dequeue.
</p>
<p>
To overload the class constructor, we can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments">arguments array</a> to pass an existing array and create a new one if none is passed.
</p>
<p>
Finally, to return both the dequeued item and a new queue as a single result, we can use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_Variables,_and_Literals#Object_literals">object literal</a>.
</p>
The finished product looks like this:
<pre>var Queue = function() {
	var items = arguments.length &gt; 0 ? arguments[0] : new Array();

	return {
		length: function() {
			return items.length;
		},
		isEmpty: function() {
			return this.length() == 0;
		},
		enqueue: function(item) {
			var newItems = items.slice(0);
			newItems.push(item);
			return new Queue(newItems);
		},
		dequeue: function() {
			var newItems = items.slice(0);
			var item = newItems.shift();
			return {
				queue: new Queue(newItems),
				value: item
			};
		},
		head: function() {
			return items[0];
		}
	};
}</pre>
