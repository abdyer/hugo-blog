    weekend. Jamie and I went to the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/frenchkicks">French Kicks</a> concert at <a
        href="http://www.4215washington.com/">Walter's</a> on Friday night with some friends. Houston's own <a
        href="http://www.myspace.com/youngmammals">Young Mammals</a> (formerly The Dimes) opened and made me a fan
    almost instantly. It was my second time to see the French Kicks and they put on a great show yet again.<br /><br />I
    took it easy Saturday. I got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidor">humidor</a> for some quality cigars I
    recently procured and then paid another visit to my music mecca, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cactusmv">Cactus
        Records</a>. There was a DJ spinning classic blues records at Cactus and <a
        href="http://www.saintarnold.com/">Saint Arnold</a> once again provided free beer. I sipped a beer as I flipped
    through the new records. I had planned to get the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/spoon">Spoon</a> records I needed
    to complete my collection (I already had <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Ga/dp/B000RGSOQO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212987503&amp;sr=8-1">Ga
        Ga Ga Ga Ga</a> and <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Sneaks-US-Bonus-Tracks/dp/B000067FU3/ref=pd_bbs_9?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212987503&amp;sr=8-9">Series
        of Sneaks</a>), but was also excited to find <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bornruffians">Born Ruffians</a>'
    latest as well. So my collection now includes:<br />
    <ul>
        <li><a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Can-Tell-Spoon/dp/B000056O2Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212987503&amp;sr=8-5">Spoon
                - Girls Can Tell</a></li>
        <li><a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/Kill-Moonlight-Spoon/dp/B000069DOH/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212987503&amp;sr=8-4">Spoon
                - Kill The Moonlight</a></li>
        <li><a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/Gimme-Fiction-Spoon/dp/B00082ZRN0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212987503&amp;sr=8-2">Spoon
                - Gimme Fiction</a></li>
        <li><a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Yellow-Blue-Born-Ruffians/dp/B00133KEEU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212987675&amp;sr=8-1">Born
                Ruffians - Red Yellow &amp; Blue</a></li>
    </ul>So other than the hard to find <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Telephono-Soft-Effects-Spoon/dp/B000FUF870/ref=pd_bbs_10?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212987503&amp;sr=8-10">Telephono
        &amp; Soft Effects</a>, my Spoon vinyl collection is now complete.<br /><br />I finished the weekend off with a
    10 mile run at Terry Hershey park. It was my first time to run there and the rolling hills were a nice change from
    the flats I usually run. I averaged about 10:30/mile, which is a little slower than I'd like but I took one minute
    walk breaks every eight minutes to avoid wearing myself out. I finished up with 2100 calories burned, which I
    promptly started replacing with a <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle</a> burrito and some <a
        href="http://www.saintarnold.com/beers/amber.html">Saint Arnold Amber</a>. I'm beat but feeling pretty
    accomplished. Off to bed to now to sleep like a baby...
