I've been thinking for quite some time about trying to compile a list of all the bands I've seen live over the years.  I'll put these in order as much as possible.  I plan to keep adding to this as I recall past shows and attend more in the future.  I have a ticket stub book, so I'll include the dates and other details for those I have.  Some of these are special in that the bands have since split up, are no longer touring, and/or some members have passed away.  You can find videos from a lot of these shows on my [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/dammitandy) channel.  Here we go:
