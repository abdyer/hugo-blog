Time files and it turns out it's been several years since I [last shared](/blog/2016/01/02/top-10-albums-of-2015/) my favorite albums of the year. Despite the lack of posts, I still keep a list every year and decided it's time once again to highlight some of the albums I've enjoyed most:

1. **Oh Sees - Face Stabber** Any year that includes an Oh Sees release will find it [in my top albums list](/blog/2013/12/22/top-10-albums-of-2013/), so here it is. I also [see them anytime their tour comes through town](/blog/2009/04/19/bands-ive-seen-live/). Again, no exception this year. The band continues its exploration of prog rock while still retaining just enough of their psych rock foundation to sound unmistakably like themselves.
1. **Chris Staples - Holy Moly** Not to be confused with the much more country-fied [Chris Stapleton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zAThXFOy2c), Chris Staples is a new discovery for me this year. I'd describe him as indie singer/songwriter with a strong Wilco sensibility. I'm looking forward to seeing him here in Berlin next month.
1. **Ty Segall - Deforming Lobes (Live), First Taste** Similar to the Oh Sees guarantee above, Ty Segall [always](/blog/2014/12/26/top-10-albums-of-2014/) makes the year's top albums list as well. This year, the prolific psych rocker gave me two albums to love; a live album and the [notably guitarless](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ty-segall-first-taste/) "First Taste" (although it's hard to believe some of these sounds aren't guitars).
1. **Wilco - Ode to Joy** Wilco is another perennial favorite of mine. Jeff Tweedy's songwriting is as strong as ever and this album is one that deepens a bit with each listen.
1. **Versing - 10000** A wonderful recreation of that [Pavement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2Nsy4h8rD4) and [Built to Spill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVtskhcGOtc) slacker rock sound with a dash of Nirvana style grunge. All the ingredients for a good album.
1. **Spoon - Everything Hits at Once (Best Of)** Spoon is another of my favorites that makes [any year's](/blog/2014/12/26/top-10-albums-of-2014/) top albums list. This is a "best of" spanning most of their albums, with the disappointing absence of a [killer track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVOvxT5GZi8) or [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCgfLSuf2O8) from "Series of Sneaks". Nevertheless, the track order is great and this collection should serve as a solid introduction for anyone as yet unfamiliar with their greatness.
1. **Khruangbin - Hasta El Cielo** Painfully known to me as the band I missed seeing last year due to a calendar time zone mixup, Khruangbin released a [dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music) version of their wonderful ["Con Todo El Mundo"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cN1XCpfWD4) album. I love how the different style further mellows what was already a pretty laid back sound. Perfect for a rainy Sunday morning.
1. **Ari Roar - Best Behavior** Bouncy guitar and bass lines that remind me of bands like [Pinback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59cQWw9ctOA) or [Palm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKJkq-fuFKU) paired with breezy vocals. Soundtrack a windows-down-stereo-up car ride with this.
1. **(Sandy) Alex G - House of Sugar** Introspective and at times haunting lyrics softened with acoustic guitar & a sprinkle of [lo-fi wooze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcO-NPtj5BI).
1. **Dead Soft - Big Blue** I'm a sucker for 90s guitar rock like [early Weezer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlfkFMjLZc) or [Matthew Sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNfocDNZWY8). Dead Soft does this well.

Here's a playlist with one of my favorite songs from each album. Enjoy!
