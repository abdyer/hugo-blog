This is my second year to speak at the [Big Android BBQ](http://www.bigandroidbbq.com/) in Hurst, TX. My talk covered a slew of handy open source libraries to accelerate the development of modern Android applications.

The slides are available on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7Daz4FEcG6Dbkx2RGVjYTNvaUE/edit?usp=sharing).

I'm having a blast at the conference. The sessions so far have been great. I hope to see all of you here again next year!
