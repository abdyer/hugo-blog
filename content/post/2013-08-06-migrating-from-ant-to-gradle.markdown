I'll be giving a talk on migrating a custom Eclipse/Ant build to Android Studio/Gradle at [tonight's Houston Android Developers meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Houston-Android-Developers/events/132350872/). The slides are available on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15TekbzLYvs1bfAgpRx_2yWsA_il1HPEIkFR-mNmPlSc/edit?usp=sharing).

I hope to see you there!
