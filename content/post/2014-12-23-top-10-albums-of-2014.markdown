The end of another year means it's time for the annual Top 10 Favorite Albums list.

1. **Ty Segall - Manipulator** While not the leader in sheer track plays via my Google Play Music account, this album is perfect all the way through. It certainly spent a lot of time on my turntable as well.
1. **Nothing - Guilty of Everything** A wonderful example of the specific brand of rock music I love. Heavily [MBV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxXn60Z0yk) influenced wall of sound guitars. They were almost deafeningly loud when I saw them at [Fitzgerald's](http://fitzlivemusic.com) over the summer.
1. **Whirr - Sway** One of the members of Nothing also founded Whirr. As you might expect, they have a similar sound. Similarly awesome.
1. **Sturgill Simpson - Metamodern Sounds in Country Music** Like a modern day [Waylon Jennings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14ZHn_76QM0). While I'm not a big country fan, I can appreciate honest, heartfelt songs. These are.
1. **Spoon - They Want My Soul** Such a consistent band. Their sound evolves slightly with each album, yet they always sound like Spoon.
1. **Meatbodies - Meatbodies** Ty Segall's [Fuzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDEmMyowfPU) band mate Chad Ubovich also helms Meatbodies. Psych rock, fuzz, reverb, etc. [Thee Oh Sees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuYOMvTLoJo)/Ty Segall type rock n' roll.
1. **Parquet Courts - Sunbathing Animal** Their slacker rock sound reminds me a bit of [Pavement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPvhKV3Yg2k). Simple yet catchy songs.
1. **Cheatahs - Cheatahs** On par with the Nothing and Whirr albums on the list, more fuzzy droning shoegaze-y goodness.
1. **Schoolboy Q - Oxymoron** I continued exploring hip-hop this year and this album led the pack. "Los Awesome" is like a modern day "[California Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbXQQG9B6c)". "[Collard Greens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L2vJEb6lVE)" features Kendrick Lamar and name checks Houston. And more. What else do you need?
1. **Vince Staples - Hell Can Wait** Vince Staples has [collaborated with Earl Sweatshirt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGfE-mbdmXg) (whose "Doris" album was on my list last year) and toured this year with Schoolboy Q. Apparently my ear is also finely tuned for a specific style of hip-hop. Whatever the case, this album will get your head nodding if you're into that sort of thing.

I made a YouTube playlist with one of my favorite songs from each album. Enjoy!
