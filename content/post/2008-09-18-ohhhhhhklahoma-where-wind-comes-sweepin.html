    I hightailed it out of Houston last Wednesday when it was pretty clear Ike was gonna slap us around.  Unlike most of
    those trying to evacuate, I eschewed the ever popular I-10 and I-45 routes for Highway 6.  I followed that up
    through Waco and then hit I-35 up to my parents' in Oklahoma City.  Along the way, I enjoyed another non-Dominican
    cigar and cranked the tunes.<div><br /></div>
    <div>Since I've been in OKC, I've made the most of it.  Power was out in our office, so I didn't do any work until
        Tuesday.  I hit <a href="http://www.myspace.com/guestroomrecords">Guest Room Records</a> on the north side of
        town where I picked up the Black Kids' "<a

            Wall</a>" on vinyl.  While I love my Cactus, Guest Room is a helluva store.  They also have a store in
        Norman, home of my alma mater, <a href="http://www.ou.edu/web/home.html">OU</a> (Boomer Sooner!), which I plan
        to visit on my way out of town.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>I've done a lot hanging out with friends.  We went to <a
            href="http://oklahomacity.citysearch.com/profile/33547844/oklahoma_city_ok/electro_lounge.html">Electro
            Lounge</a> one night and I was thoroughly impressed.  Great beer selection (<a
            href="http://www.sierranevada.com/">Sierra Nevada</a>, <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/">Stone</a>, <a
            href="http://www.unibroue.com/english.cfm">Unibroue</a>, etc.) and an amazing jukebox (<a

            Lips</a>, and on and on).  My kind of place!  We hit <a href="http://www.makersokc.com/">Maker's</a> in <a
            href="http://www.bricktownokc.com/">Bricktown</a> another night for cigars and cocktails.  I saw the <a

            Lips Alley</a> street sign for the first time there but unfortunately I wasn't able to get a good picture of
        it with my phone.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Last night, we watched some friends' band play happy hour at <a
            href="http://www.mickeymantlesteakhouse.com/">Mickey Mantle's</a> downtown.  After that, we ended up at <a
            href="http://www.buffalowildwings.com/">Buffalo Wild Wings</a> for karaoke.  It's been quite awhile since I
        did it, but I rose above the mediocrity of many of my fellow karaokers (okay, so that may not really be a word)
        to deliver an animated performance of John Michael Montgomery's "Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)".

    <div>I'm so ready to head back to H-Town, but dreading the stench in my fridge.  I still have no power, but luckily
        Jamie snagged us a place where we can stay for a couple weeks if necessary.  <a
