    Since I put together my inaugural Top 10 list last year, I may as well make it a tradition. Luckily I had the
    foresight to keep a running list in <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> throughout the year, so the
    tough part was putting them in order. Some may argue about the order of the albums on the list or the exclusion of
    others. I'd love to hear your opinions.<div><br /></div>
    <div>So without any further <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eisa5AZ20W0">jibba jabba</a>, here's my Top 10
        Albums of 2010 list:</div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Manor-Local-Natives/dp/B0032IAB4C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593217&amp;sr=8-1">Local
                        Natives - Gorilla Manor</a></b> The harmonies are amazing. I saw these guys twice this year and
                loved both shows.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Flaming-Stardeath-Dwarfs-Rollins-Peaches/dp/B003D8O8FY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593246&amp;sr=1-1">Flaming
                        Lips - Dark Side of the Moon</a> </b>I was lucky enough to see the Lips perform this on <a
                    href="/blog/2010/01/02/my-review-of-flaming-lips-new-years-eve/">NYE 2009 in OKC</a>. A great cover
                of a great album.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Black-Keys/dp/B003AO1SVS/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593281&amp;sr=1-1">The
                        Black Keys - Brothers</a></b> I listened to this album over and over this past summer. Nice
                gritty bluesy rock.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Blood-Yeasayer/dp/B0030E5NKU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593310&amp;sr=1-1">Yeasayer
                        - Odd Blood</a></b> Another band I saw live this year. Upbeat indie rock to enliven any task or
                workout.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Astro-Coast-Surfer-Blood/dp/B002ZPIBG8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593332&amp;sr=1-1">Surfer
                        Blood - Astro Coast</a></b> Surf rock sound thanks to lots of Telecaster but new and different
                at the same time. Plus a song about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/">David Lynch</a>.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Say-Born-Ruffians/dp/B003A2HXAK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593352&amp;sr=1-1">Born
                        Ruffians - Say It</a></b> I saw these guys play at the <a
                    href="http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2010/09/i_want_this_place_to.php">newly reopened
                    Fitzgerald's</a> in my 'hood. Great live show. Catchy album.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Transference-Spoon/dp/B002VDZIIS/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593396&amp;sr=1-1">Spoon
                        - Transference</a></b> Few bands consistently release great albums while gradually morphing
                their sound. Spoon does. Another constant listen this past year.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/King-Beach-Wavves/dp/B003SNYZVG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593414&amp;sr=1-1">Wavves
                        - King of the Beach</a></b> The summer of 2010 was a brief indie surf rock renaissance. Or maybe
                I'm discounting a trend with a longer shelf life. But I'm no critic. Good album for the beach. Or kings
                of them.</li>
            <li><b><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Smile-Suckers/dp/B003HLT0BO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593441&amp;sr=1-1">Suckers
                        - Wild Smile</a></b> These guys toured with Local Natives and the first time I heard them was
                when they opened that show. Bad ass tunes kinda like Local Natives but not. Apples and oranges, but
                still fresh &amp; delicious organic fruit (I may have yuppied that fruit part up a bit, but oh well).
            </li>
            <li><b><a href="http://giantprincess.blogspot.com/p/merch.html">Giant Princess - Zip Zop Wow</a></b> Awesome
                new band from the H Tizzle. Raucous indie rock. Saw them do an in store at my beloved <a
                    href="http://twitter.com/#!/cactus_music">Cactus Music</a> and dug it.</li>
        </ol>
