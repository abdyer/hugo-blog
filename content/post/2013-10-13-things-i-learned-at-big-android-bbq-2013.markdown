- T-Mobile reception is still terrible at the conference center.
- Alcohol purchases spike in the City of Hurst as a result of the conference.
- The guys from [Willow Tree Apps](http://www.willowtreeapps.com/) have released some awesome Android open source libraries ([BetterPickers](https://github.com/derekbrameyer/android-betterpickers), [OAK](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/OAK), and [RPatch](https://github.com/JonathanNye/rpatch))
- It's worth the short drive to [Roots Coffee](http://rootscoffeehouse.com/north-richland-hills/) each morning.
- [High Roller](http://www.highrollerusa.com/shop/) makes adult size big wheels. They are a ton of fun to ride.
- [Oppo](http://en.oppo.com/) makes some pretty sweet phones. Their [N1 will ship with](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/23/4762618/oppo-n1-announced-cyanogenmod-android-rotating-camera) [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/).
- I wish I had signed up for the [Google Glass Explorer](http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/) program.
- [Daniel Ward](https://plus.google.com/112937922652870132700) bears a [strong resemblance](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-y68HoUyN5-Y/Uln1HvB7fRI/AAAAAAAARcw/D--lqBnDrJg/w852-h474/daniel-obiwan.jpg) to Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi.
- Google makes Android. Anyone who attended the closing keynote/panel will understand why this is funny.
- [Ray Walters'](https://plus.google.com/111558319297322546031) BBQ: OMG. So good!
- Agile is dead. Liquid will soon be the new hotness. More on this later.

I thoroughly enjoyed the conference once again this year. I highly recommend it to anyone who has anything to do with Android.
