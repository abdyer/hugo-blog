This was my third time attending the Big Android BBQ in Hurst, TX and my third time to present at it. Perhaps my favorite thing about the conference (aside from the obvious BBQ) is reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. This year I've had the pleasure of meeting people from all over the world and learning that we know a lot of the same people. Small world, indeed.

Below are the slides from my talk, which focused on the challenges of sharing a large codebase with a team of multiple developers.
