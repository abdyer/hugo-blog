    When working with the GridView in an Android app recently, I ran into a very strange behavior around setting the
    selected state for a view created in my ArrayAdapter's getView() method.  I'm using selectors to handle the drawable
    states and everything works properly when tapping a list item to select/tapping again to unselect.  When debugging
    the ArrayAdapter's getView() method, I could see that the selected state was being set to the correct value when
    calling view.setSelected(), but the button background was not updated to the proper state.
</p>
<p>
    After going on the obligatory StackOverflow &amp; Google scavenger hunt, I eventually came across <a
        title="this post" href="http://www.blackmoonit.com/2011/03/android-listview-and-setselection/">this post</a>,
    which addresses how to call the setSelection() method in a single-select ListView.  It turns out that the same
    approach is needed when calling setSelected() on an individual view.
</p>
<p>
    In short, you must do this:
</p>
<pre>private void setSelected(final View view, final boolean selected) {
    view.post(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            view.setSelected(selected);
        }
    });
}</pre>
<p>
    The key is posting a runnable on the UI thread to set the selected state. Otherwise, the view is marked as selected
    but its visual state is unchanged.
