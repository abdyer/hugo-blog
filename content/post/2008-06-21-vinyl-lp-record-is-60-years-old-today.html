I just got an email from <a href="http://www.soundstagedirect.com/">Sound Stage Direct</a>, one of my favorite online record stores, which said the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_album">vinyl LP record</a> is 60 years old today (invented June 21, 1948 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Carl_Goldmark">Peter Goldmark</a>).  I searched good ol' YouTube and found the video below which does a good job of providing some history about the format as well as some insight into how exactly records are made.  Very interesting...<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tggLYE87Ed0&amp;hl=en"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tggLYE87Ed0&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="344" width="425"></embed></object></div>
