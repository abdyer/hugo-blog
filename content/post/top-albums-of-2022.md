This year's top albums list is a mix of chill & aggressive, ranging from folky Americana, to psych rock, and even punk. While past favorites Kendrick Lamar & Earl Sweatshirt both released long-awaited albums, I did not find myself returning to them the way I did with their previous releases.

This list is probably the first that has included a new mix of an album that was released in a different year (The Beatles - Revolver), but I think it sounds so modern, its inclusion is defensible. And it's my list, so my rules, right?

1. **Spoon - Lucifer on the Sofa** This was easily my most listened. It's yet another Spoon album (in the best way possible), but this one was made for playing live.
1. **Big Thief - Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You** This album won me over after years of being aware of Big Thief, but not really considering myself a fan. It shows so many different sides of the band; there's something here for everyone.
1. **The Black Angels - Wilderness of Mirrors** Austin's psych rock heroes return with so many great songs. I need to visit [Levitation](https://levitation.fm/) to catch them live again soon. The last time was in [2013](/blog/2009/04/19/bands-ive-seen-live)!
1. **Kurt Vile - (watch my moves)** Kurt Vile has a laid-back sound & style uniquely his own. Daydream fuel...if you know...whut I mean.
1. **Osees - A Foul Form** Predictably, I have an Osees/Oh Sees/OCS/Thee Oh Sees album on the list! The prog-rock sounds of the last few albums have been supplanted by thrash/skate punk. The harsh mix itself acts as an instrument to evoke raw punk rock on cassette. It's short enough to listen to twice in a row, which I did often.
1. **The Chats - Get Fucked** Surf punk from Brisbane, Australia. Standout tracks include [Panic Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBeu6wEZDqw)-tack-tack-tack-tack-tack, [The Price of Smokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cawY4hXfe0o) (the economy-minded sequel to [Smoko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58V2vC9EPc)) and [6L GTR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrkuo0y8gMU).
1. **Alex G - God Save the Animals** An Alex G album also made it on the [2019 list](/blog/2019/12/23/top-albums-of-2019/). This one has a lot of the same elements I appreciated on House of Sugar.
1. **Wilco - Cruel Country** Wilco & country, what else do you need? This double album dials down the trademark Wilco mid-tempo ever so slightly most of the time, giving the listener time to feel the melancholy lyrics a bit more intensely.
1. **Oren Ambarchi, Johan Berthling & Andreas Werliin - Ghosted** This discovery can most certainly be attributed to NPR Music, either the [All Songs Considered](https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/) or [New Music Friday](https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/606254804/new-music-friday) podcast. Percussive, minimal jazz to soundtrack heady conversations with yourself or others.
1. **The Beatles - Revolver (2022 Mix)** What if The Beatles recorded an album with modern technology? Since we can't do that, what if we use modern technology to separate the instruments/voices from the source tapes and mix that, again with modern technology? [This episode](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/28/1132221589/youve-never-heard-the-beatles-revolver-sound-like-this) of the aforementioned NPR All Songs Considered podcast explains how that works in more detail. The result is stunning to anyone who's fairly familiar with the 56 year old album.

Here's a playlist with a song from each of the above albums:
