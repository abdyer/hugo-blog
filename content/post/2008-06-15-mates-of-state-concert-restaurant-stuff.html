    Jamie I saw <a href="http://www.myspace.com/matesofstate">Mates of State</a> this past Thursday at <a
        href="http://www.warehouselive.com/">Warehouse Live</a>. I've really been digging their new album, <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Re-Arrange-Us-Mates-State/dp/B0016MJ2PU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1213562189&amp;sr=8-1">Re-Arrange
        Us</a> and it was my first time to see them live. For only two people, their unique combination of keyboard,
    drums, and vocal harmony makes for a nice, full sound. I picked their latest up on vinyl, which overflowed my record
    collection into its <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40101276">2nd crate</a>.<br /><br />Here's a
    video I took of "Get Better" and "Think Long":<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425">

            width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />Jamie surprised me with the <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Critic-Houston-Restaurant-Guide/dp/0974014346/">Fearless Critic's guide to
        Houston restaurants</a> and since I've been wanting some Korean food for awhile now, we checked the reviews and
    decided to try <a
        href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/43106853/houston_tx/bonga_korean_restaurant.html">Bonga</a> the
    other night. I lived in Korea a couple times as a kid when my dad was stationed there, so I was familiar with a few
    of the dishes. We shared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi">bulgogi</a> and <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi">kimchi</a>, two of the most well-known. It was great to try something
    new and the review gave us confidence that we wouldn't be disappointed. We weren't. The guide gave it a grade of A-
    and I have to agree. Very tasty stuff at a reasonable price.<br /><br />We met some friends at <a
        href="http://www.onioncreekcafe.com/">Onion Creek</a> for dinner last night, mainly because I wanted to try <a
        href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/337/43157">Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #6</a>, a limited release beer
    OC has on draft. This edition is an American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley_wine">Barleywine</a> and
    for those of you who aren't beer geeks, think of running to the record store when your favorite band puts out a new
    album. Only replace record store with <a href="http://www.specsonline.com/">Spec's</a> and album with limited
    edition microbrew. In other words, something to get excited about if you're into such things. The beer weighs in at
    a hefty 10% abv, so a couple pints was all I could endure in one sitting.<br /><br />This morning, I wanted some
    non-<a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">corporate coffee</a>, so I decided to stop by <a
        href="http://www.b4-u-eat.com/houston/restaurants/reviews/rsv0996.asp">Cafe Artiste</a> for some. I was very
    disappointed to find the parking lot empty and a "For Lease" sign in the window. That was such a great place! It
    will be missed...</div>
