This is my third year to attend and present at the [Big Android BBQ](http://www.bigandroidbbq.com/). [My talk](http://news.bigandroidbbq.com/2014/09/speaker-spotlight-andrew-dyer.html) this year showed how to prepare an Android app for automated testing using mocking, dependency injection, and Google's super fast Espresso test runner. You can find the presentation on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/abdyer/babbq5-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications) and the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/abdyer/android-test-demo).
