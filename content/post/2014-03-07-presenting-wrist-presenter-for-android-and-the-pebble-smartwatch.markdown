Shortly after getting a Pebble Smartwatch this past Christmas, my coworker and all-around-cool-dude [Matthew Morey](http://matthewmorey.com/) asked me if I'd be interested in developing the Android version of his [Wrist Presenter iOS app](http://matthewmorey.com/wrist-presenter/). Luckily, he already had a rock solid Pebble app developed, so I didn't have to flex my meager C programming skills.

[Wrist Presenter](http://wristpresenter.com/) turns your Pebble Smartwatch into a remote for presentations running on your Android or iOS device.

The Android app connects to your Google Drive account(s) and displays a list of presentations. Selecting a presentation launches it full screen on your Android device and the companion app on the Pebble. In addition to Google Drive Presentations, raw image slides are also supported and even work without a network connection. This makes it possible to use your presentations at conferences where network connectivity is often poor to nonexistent.

Chromecast support may be added in the future if Google or [Koush](http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/03/05/koush-updates-mirror-with-super-beta-support-for-chromecast-screen-mirroring-currently-for-rooted-nexus-5-only/) don't enable full screen mirroring before then. At the moment, you can connect your Android device to a projector with a [Miracast dongle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2D3N0M/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00H2D3N0M&linkCode=as2&tag=slacod-20) or an [HDMI adapter](http://www.kanexlive.com/slimport) on compatible devices.

I look forward to upping my "geek cred" with Wrist Presenter at conferences this year. The app is free to try and unlimited slides can be unlocked via an in-app purchase.

Wrist Presenter is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dandydev.wristpresenter) and the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wrist-presenter-wireless-presentation/id735128848?mt=8&amp;at=10l6oV&amp;ct=mm_wrist-presenter). Download now and let us know what you think.
