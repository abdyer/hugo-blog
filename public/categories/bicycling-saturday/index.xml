      <description>&lt;div class=&#39;post&#39;&gt;
So I&#39;m up at 6:00 am on a Saturday morning about to go meet some friends for a bike ride.  We&#39;ll be doing at least 25 miles, but maybe 50 if we feel up for it.     Crazy I know, but there&#39;s a certain excitement around getting up early, eating a carbolicious breakfast, drinking some coffee, and hitting the road for awhile.  My only real complaint is how much gear is involved in a simple bike ride.  For those of you who have read Aldous Huxley&#39;s &#34;Brave New World&#34; (if not, I highly recommend it), cycling is like one of those sports mentioned in the book that requires an arsenal of equipment to participate.  A short list of things I&#39;ve assembled for this morning&#39;s ride include: cycling jersey/shorts/shoes, heart rate monitor, helmet, gloves, sunglasses, spare bike tubes/CO2 cartridges, energy bars, energy gels, Gatorade, water, recovery drink.  Insane, huh?
